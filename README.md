## Installation

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/melowsoft/getir-store
```
- cd into project directory with: 

```bash
  cd getir-store/client
```

**Note: The Client depends on Json server for fetching data, hence you need to run json-server to serve the client ***

- To run json-server:
first install json-server on your local machine, if you don't have it installed with

```bash
  npm install -g json-server
```
when you have json-server installed, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
  npx json-server --watch db.json --port 5000
```
to expose the api on port localhost://5000

**Note: json-server should run on a different port from our react app ***

- Finally you can now cd into the react app and start the app with:

```bash
  npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
